/*If an array is rotated and sorted, we already know that for every index, one of the 2 halves of the array will always be sorted.
In this situation, we have two possibilities to consider. The sorted half of the array may or may not include the minimum value. However, we can leverage the property of the sorted half, specifically that the leftmost element of the sorted half will always be the minimum element within that particular half.

During each iteration, we will select the leftmost element from the sorted half and discard that half from further consideration. Among all the selected elements, the minimum value will serve as our answer.

To facilitate this process, we will declare a variable called ‘ans’ and initialize it with a large number. Then, at each step, after selecting the leftmost element from the sorted half, we will compare it with ‘ans’ and update ‘ans’ with the smaller value (i.e., min(ans, leftmost_element)).

/***********further optimisation*******/
/*If both the left and right halves of an index are sorted, it implies that the entire search space between the low and high indices is also sorted. In this case, there is no need to conduct a binary search within that segment to determine the minimum value. Instead, we can simply select the leftmost element as the minimum.

The condition to check will be arr[low] <= arr[mid] && arr[mid] <= arr[high]. We can shorten this into arr[low] <= arr[high] as well.

If arr[low] <= arr[high]: In this case, the array from index low to high is completely sorted. Therefore, we can simply select the minimum element, arr[low], and update the ‘ans’ variable with the minimum value i.e. min(ans, arr[low]). Once this is done, there is no need to continue with the binary search algorithm.*/
